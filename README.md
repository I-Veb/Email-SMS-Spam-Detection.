# SMS/Email Spam Classification Model

This project implements an end-to-end spam classification model for both SMS and email messages using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The model achieves a high accuracy of 97.8% and an exceptional precision score. It incorporates various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques during the preprocessing of data to enhance performance.

## Key Features

- **Naive Bayes Algorithm**: The model is built using the Naive Bayes algorithm, a popular choice for text classification tasks due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

- **NLP Techniques**: Several NLP techniques are applied during data preprocessing to improve the model's performance. These techniques may include tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming or lemmatization.

- **Integration with Pickle**: The trained model is integrated across diverse environments using Pickle, a Python module for serializing and deserializing objects. This allows for seamless deployment and integration into various platforms and environments.

- **Conversion to Web Application**: The model is converted into a web application using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications. This enables users to interact with the model through a user-friendly interface.

- **Deployment on Heroku**: The web application is deployed on the Heroku cloud platform for optimal performance and scalability. Heroku provides a robust infrastructure for hosting web applications and scaling them as needed.

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Dependencies Installation**: Install the required dependencies, including Streamlit and any other libraries used for model training and preprocessing.

3. **Model Training**: Train the Naive Bayes model using the provided dataset. Optionally, fine-tune the model or experiment with different preprocessing techniques for better performance.

4. **Integration with Pickle**: Serialize the trained model using Pickle for deployment across diverse environments.

5. **Conversion to Web Application**: Use Streamlit to create a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the spam classification model.

6. **Deployment on Heroku**: Deploy the web application on the Heroku cloud platform for optimal performance and scalability.
